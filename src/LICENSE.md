## Effort Model & Weights Attribution & License

### Model / Method
- **Model / Method:** Effort (generalizable AI-generated image detection)
- **Paper:** *Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection* (arXiv:2411.15633)
- **Reference implementation:** `YZY-stack/Effort-AIGI-Detection`  
  - Contains Effort-related implementation within/alongside the DeepfakeBench structure.

### License / Terms of Use
- The Effort implementation repository indicates usage under **Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)** *(non-commercial)*.
- The upstream framework **DeepfakeBench** is also distributed under **CC BY-NC 4.0**, which restricts usage to **non-commercial** purposes.

### Weights (Checkpoints) Note
- This project uses locally stored checkpoints (e.g., `effort_clip_L14_trainOn_FaceForensic.pth`).
- Unless the authors explicitly provide a different license for the weight files, treat the weights as being subject to the **same CC BY-NC 4.0 non-commercial restriction** as the referenced Effort/DeepfakeBench resources.

### Notes
- This repository does **not** redistribute third-party training datasets.
- Users must comply with **CC BY-NC 4.0 requirements (attribution)** and the **non-commercial restriction** when using or adapting the Effort code/weights.
